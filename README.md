# Coin tosser
This program was made to simplify the performance of laboratory work in physics, where it was necessary to simulate the decay of radionuclides by tossing a physical coin. This program can toss coins as long as your computer able to do (long integers aren't supported yet).

### Example run
In the project directory run:
```
make
./tosscoins 12 3
```

Output:
```
1. Eagles dropped 7 times.
   Tail dropped 5 times.
2. Eagles dropped 7 times.
   Tail dropped 5 times.
3. Eagles dropped 6 times.
   Tail dropped 6 times.
```
